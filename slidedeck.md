Yelp Challenge Project
========================================================
## Review Rating Prediction
Author: David √Ålvarez Pons



========================================================

## Yelp Challenge data description

The Yelp company gathers reviews from users attending to restaurants, clinics and other services.

Each review contains a star rating that is given by a user to the rated business.

## Project description

Can we predict the rating of a review looking at its text?

We present the implementation of **a prediction function for star-rating based on machine learning**

Exploratory analysis
========================================================

The data used for this project is available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset.zip):

```r
ct <- cor.test(log(textLengths), stars)
```

Since the p-value of the correlation test is 0, there is no relation between text length and rating. 

Prediction modelling
========================================================

1. Split texts into sentences. 
2. Clean stopwords, numbers, punctuation, word sufixes and sort words without duplicates. 
3. Count words + sentence rating.
4. Prediction of a sentence is a weighted sum: 




```
          word count stars avg.stars
4975   horribl    24    28  1.166667
5260    orbitz     6     7  1.166667
3     favorite  1496  6488  4.336898
94   delicious  1573  6648  4.226319
```

$$predict(sent) \gets \frac{\sum_{w\in sent}w.count * w.avgStars}{\sum_{w \in sent} w.count}$$

Results and Discussion
========================================================












Predictions errors have $\mu$ = -0.0067505 and $\sigma$=1.3158128.  
RSME is 1.3158202.  
Prediction model tends to be *too optimistic*.

**Improvements**: gather sets of words, cross validation, `tm` package, etc.
